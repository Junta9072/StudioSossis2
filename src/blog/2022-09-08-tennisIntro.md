<p>A sensorAPI based pong clone</p><br>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>10nis is a project that I developed over the summer of 2022, it's a first time for a lot of things, three.js, p5 canvas, sensorAPI and running a substantial express server communicating with clients through socket.io.</p><br>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>The project still has some bugs and is missing a lot of quality of life improvements. You can visit the page on gitHub, but there is no live build.</p><br>
