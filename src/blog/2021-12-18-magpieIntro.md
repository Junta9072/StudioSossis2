description: A location based game developed for Interface Design Lab 3
---

<p>Magpie is a project made for Interface Design Lab 3.</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Story</h3>

<p>Scour through the city of Antwerp in search of a stolen painting. Solve riddles at museums and find out what the culprit looks like. Think you've got the right one?  
If so, you'll still have to find the lost painting before it vanishes on the black market.  
Hurry, time is running out!</p>
<br><br>

<h3>About</h3>

<p>Magpie is a location based game using the MapboxAPI made by 3 Interface Design Lab students and myself. Over 4 months we designed, developed and built Magpie. The project involved setting up a wordpress website for our indie game company, using Miro to document our research and progress & of course making minigames, art assets, html, css & js.</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Status</h3>

the project is still online on netlify, but the wordpress website is offline. <br><br>
