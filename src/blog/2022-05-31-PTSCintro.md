<p>This is a project for Interface Lab 4: Visual Interaction<p><br>

<h3>About</h3>

<p>The periodic table of social contacts is a record of two weeks of messages through discord, messenger and sms</p><br>

<h3>Data visualisation</h3>
<p>Working with the theme of social media, this periodic table ranks my daily interactions based on how important, interesting and when they were sent, using tiny interactive elements, made over the course of three weeks.</p><br>

the project is still online on netlify,
