description: Het maken van deze website! Met hulp van 11ty & de netlify CMS, allemaal dankzij een tutorial van Kevin Powell

<p>You're looking at the project right now!<p><br>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>The old studio sossis would document my process using a big for each function, generating the document from a js object.<br> Obviously this isn't that efficient, but it worked just fine.<br>So after someone hit me up with Kevin Powell's tutorial using the netlifyCMS I bookmarked the tutorial, and waited untill I had some time.<br> And that is right now!</p><br>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Using the 11ty static site generator, njk templates & the netlify CMS the website generates content from .md files that can be made and edited like you would a WP admin.<br>This way if i'm working on a project, i don't have to dive into the code and can just focus on quickly adding a new project.</p><br>

Curious about the tutorial?
